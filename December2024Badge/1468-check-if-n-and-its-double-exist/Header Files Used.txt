### Header Files Used in the Project

This project uses several C++ standard header files to ensure efficient and modern programming practices. Below is the list and purpose of each header file:

#### 1. **\<vector>**
   - **Purpose**: 
     - Provides the `std::vector` container, a dynamic array capable of resizing itself automatically.
     - Allows efficient management of collections of elements, such as distances and juice capacities in our use case.
   - **Features**:
     - Supports random access using indices.
     - Provides methods for insertion, deletion, and resizing.
     - Automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation.
   - **Usage in the Project**:
     - Used to store distances of stalls and the juice capacity available at each stall.

#### 2. **\<iostream>**
   - **Purpose**: For input and output operations using `std::cin` and `std::cout`.
